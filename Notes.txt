Which one should you use?

@ModelAttribute: Best for standard HTML form submissions (best practice for Thymeleaf/JSP).
"...
@PostMapping("/saveEmployee")
	public String saveEmployee(@ModelAttribute("employee") Employee employee) {
		es.saveEmployee(employee);
		return "redirect:/";
	} other was to get data from form
..."
	
	
@RequestParam: Best for simple forms or search filters.
"...
@PostMapping("/saveEmployee")
public String saveEmployee(@RequestParam("firstName") String firstName, 
                           @RequestParam("email") String email) {
    Employee employee = new Employee(firstName, email);
    es.saveEmployee(employee);
    return "redirect:/";
}
..."


@RequestBody: Best for REST APIs and modern JavaScript frontends.
"...
@PostMapping("/saveEmployee")
public String saveEmployee(@RequestBody Employee employee) {
    es.saveEmployee(employee);
    return "redirect:/";
}
..."
